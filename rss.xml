            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Are You Sick Of Never Having Enough Traffic?</h1><p>Let's face it:GETTING TRAFFIC IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT.Paid traffic is costing an arm and a leg, and people are NOT making any returns on their investments…If you are wasting money, and not making any money back, then you are not running a sustainable business.Most so-called "free" traffic methods just leave people waiting days, weeks and even months on end, with no results. If you're lucky, maybe you will get one or two visitors…Lists are dying fast!There are so many list-building softwares out there that help you build relationships with strangers online who subscribe to your list.The problem? They don't tell you how hard it is to earn money from your subscribers!With more and more 'wannabee marketers' pushing emails out hour after hour, the chances of your subscribers opening up is dying by the minute.So while you're collecting leads, you won't be able to reach them to actually sell anything!You can't build a long term sustainable revenue on email marketing anymore…You need a new way to capture followers and actually be able to REACH THEM when you want to make money.On-demand.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/580f807875cd08a68bdda492b403320f23bb54dc.png"></article>]]></description>
